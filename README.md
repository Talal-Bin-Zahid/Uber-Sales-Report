## 📈 Visualizations & Metrics

### ⏱️ Temporal Trends

* **Total Trips by Month** and **Total Revenue by Month** visualizations reveal clear demand fluctuations.
* **Peak activity** is observed around **March** and **July–October**, indicating seasonal or event-driven ride demand.

### 📍 Pickup Location Performance

* Revenue distribution by pickup location highlights top-performing areas:

  * **Barakhamba**
  * **Khandsa**
  * **Subhash Chowk**
  * **Pataudi Chowk**
  * **Badarpur**
  * **Tughlakabad**

* **Bookings by Hour** show a strong surge during the **evening peak**, with the highest demand around **6:00 PM**, aligning with office commute hours.

### 📏 Distance Analysis

* **Bookings by Distance** illustrates how trip volumes are distributed across short, medium, and long-distance rides.
* A **Distance vs Fare scatter plot** demonstrates a **positive correlation** between ride distance and fare value, with natural variability due to pricing factors.

### 💰 Fare Buckets Analysis

Average fare comparison across distance ranges:

| Distance Range | Average Fare |
| -------------- | -----------: |
| 0–3 km         |       514.13 |
| 3–7 km         |       500.29 |
| 7–15 km        |       504.04 |
| 15+ km         |       510.32 |

This analysis shows relatively consistent average fares, with slight increases for longer trips.
